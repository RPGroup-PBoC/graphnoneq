# `graphnoneq`: the trees of life as nonequilibrium graphs
This repo organizes data, code, and analysis exploring the rich, yet regular, behaviors of of Markov networks out of equilibrium.

We have two types of codes. Some scripts generate plots, which are featured in some of our Figures, whereas other scripts are the derivation/confirmation of symbolycial computations. 

Scripts used to generate the Figures of the SI:
